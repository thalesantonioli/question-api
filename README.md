# Question API

### Short Description:
This application is responsible for saving the anamnesis responses from the HVM users

### How to run the application

The application is settled to connect to the database (RDS)

Note: The initial setup was configured to use H2 as a in memory database, however, it's necessary a few code changes to connect to RDS

After that, feel free to start the application using the _**QuestionApiApplication.kt**_

Please, get in contact within the group to get all the secrets utilized in the project.
